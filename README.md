#Star Wars API Project

##For this project I was tasked with building a UI modal from scratch and linking to an API. I chose to use the Star Wars API and display the information from orginal characters. 

##In order to view the project, clone down this repository and open the index.html file in your prefferred web browser. Once you click on each characters' picture, their information will pop up in a modal from the Star Wars API. 

##For this project I used HTML,CSS and JavaScript to make the API fetch call, and perform DOM manipulation.
